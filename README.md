This is our final year major project.This project aims at development of a tool that will generate summary of multiple related  documents in parallel and Mind Map. The approach combines linguistic and statistical methods to enhance the accuracy.Multiple documents are summarized in parallel using multi-threading technique,thereby enhancing the processing time to the larger extent.Where as the mind map will be generated from its central word. Based on the number of terms that are directly connected to this central word, radial links to those terms are made.
